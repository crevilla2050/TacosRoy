The system includes:

Order management: create, track, and close orders with support for tables, delivery, discounts, and tips.

Product catalog & combos: manage products, categories, pricing, promotions, and product variants.

Customer management: store customer details for orders, invoices, and loyalty tracking.

Billing & payments: generate invoices, support multiple payment methods, and apply commissions or discounts.

Inventory & recipes: track stock, ingredients, wastage, and recipe compositions per product.

Staff & roles: manage employees, roles, and user logins with permissions.

Reports & analytics: generate sales and operational reports for business insights.

Configuration & branches: support for multi-branch setups, custom variables, and flexible configuration.

This POS has been successfully deployed in production for over 5 years across multiple locations, proving its reliability and scalability. Built and maintained under Linux, it is optimized for stability, daily use, and adaptability.
